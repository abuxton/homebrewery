# Enchanted Bansai

Some times in even the most baron and forgotten places you will stumble upon one, it's leaves alive with the colour of the season despite the inhospitable surroundings, or them seamingly being left neglected for decades or more, the quiver of their leaves betraying a hint of their enchanted power rooted within. Inversaly sometimes a dormant will be found, seamingly dead left neglected and the slightest sense of magic, a hastily cast spell effect or passing over spray will wake it from this dormant runinous looking state.

> ***Loyal to Dragon Master.*** A dragonleaf Bansai only follows commands from its designated master (or from any creatures to whom the master grants control).
>
> ***Advantages.*** On saving throws against any charm or compulsion spell or effect. Additionally, the tree has advantage on any saving throw to resist Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks made to influence it to act against its masters.
>
> ***Weaknesses.*** Dragonleaf trees with immunity to fire also have vulnerability to cold, and trees with immunity to cold have vulnerability to fire.
> ### Actions
> ***Calming Mist.*** (Recharge 5–6). The Bansai releases a calming gas in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the warbler for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
>
> ***Breath Weapon*** (Recharge 6). A dragonleaf bansai can issue forth a breath weapon from its leaves appropriate to the dragon it honors at 1/3rd damage.
>
>___
> ### About
> *** Gifts among Dragons.*** These magnificent creations are imbued with some characteristics of their draconic masters. Dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal.
>
> *** Silent Guardians.*** Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless and inconspicuous. Once a target is in teh area of effect it releases it's mists, or if provoked defends with it's breath weapon.
>
> ***Long Memories.*** Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years.  Growing a new dragonleaf Bansai requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree’s master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a week. While this time barely registers on a dragon’s whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness. The bansai created this way retains all memories of it's donor.
