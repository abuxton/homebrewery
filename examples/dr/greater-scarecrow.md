# Greater Scarecrow

When the people new to the land talk of the horror that befel those that came before them, they never name the creature. Regardless dutifully they return it's fallen empty sack of a body to it's post, knowing that it provides a role in the cycle of the land. When they do, they do so hoping the malign spirit that shares its name as left their lands or the lands they now tend and has finished with them, and that who or what ever brought the angry spirit to the land as gone with it.


##  Escaped not summoned

The difference between the origin and the Greater Scarecrow is creation. Not summoned, not sacrificed and not bound. Escaped, vengeful and wiley evil. A greater scarecrow is where the spirit of a dieing evil as made a pact on it's final breath that has allowed it to live on. The pact is always with a malevolent creature that accepts unwilling tributes and has knowledge of the domains of Grave and Nature (Trickery, Earth and Destruction in Faerun), creating a twisted Druid Warlock creature of chaotic evil nature.

### Stories told

It is always told that scarecrows come to the land, stalking quietly onto cursed lands. Slowly killing first the land, then the inhabitants the livestock first the settlers  last, slowly over days if not weeks. Once the land and the inhabitants are dried up it simply leaves as if no malice was intended, just the land returned to it's own care.
