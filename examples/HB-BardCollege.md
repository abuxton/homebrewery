# Bard College


D

<div class='descriptive'>
##### you hear the word?

Some bards collect songs, others collect stories, and then there are those seeking to collect the truth? Which ever version of it suits them unfortunatley.
	
How they spread this truth is equally unusual, they don't seek to entertain in the taverns, or inspire their party of friends around them. Well not immediatly. 

They seek to spread the word of their fame and their story far and wide, and that of the misdeeds of others equally. Encompassing all in the fabled Broadsheet or Short Scrolls of the realms they frequent. 
	
	Some time going as far as to be responsible for publishing these broadsheets betrween adventures.
